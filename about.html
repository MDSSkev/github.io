					Rock Pathfinders have been walking as a group for 30 years. The group was started by a few keen walkers who all lived in the village of
					Rock.
					At that time many of the ancient footpaths were not passable and so the group set about clearing and re-discovering the paths and they
					formed
					Rock Parish Footpaths Association.<br><br>

					Clearing the overgrown paths was a major task and and new members were recruited to help with the work. The local parish council was
					approached to help with funds to purchase finger posts and stiles. Once a few routes had been established walks were organised and held on
					the
					first Sunday of the month. Each walker was asked to pay a small subscription to add to the funds needed for materials.<br><br>

					The walks became more popular as word spread about the beautiful countryside the paths went through. The group eventually gained support
					from
					the County Council and received aid on the form of annual grant they could apply for. Rock is the second largest parish in the country and
					ancient maps showed there had been 149 footpaths.<br><br>

					The work was all done by volunteers and it took many years but now all the paths are opened, well way marked. Bridges, ditch crossings,
					finger
					post and stiles are still maintained by the volunteers and the footpath warden, although now the County Council provide the materials so
					the
					group no longer has to worry about fund raising. However, it is important to keep the paths open by making sure they are regularly walked
					and
					any faults reported.<br><br>

					The group changed their name in 2009 to Rock Pathfinders when they decided to increase the walks to twice a month and extended to routes
					outside the parish boundary. The walks are now held on first and third Thursdays in the month and during the summer there are some evening
					walks.<br><br>
					All new walkers and anyone interested in helping with the maintenance are always welcomed.
